# Advanced Topics in Machine Learning
This repository contains the following:

## 1) Approximate Inference and Unsupervised Learning Notes and Assignments:
This course is taken by the Gatsby Computational and Neuroscience Unit at UCL. It is an in-depth introduction to statistical modelling, unsupervised, and some supervised learning techniques. It presents probabilistic approaches to modelling and their relation to coding theory and Bayesian statistics. A variety of latent variable models are covered including mixture models (used for clustering), dimensionality reduction methods, time series models such as hidden Markov models which are used in speech recognition and bioinformatics, Gaussian process models, independent components analysis, hierarchical models, and nonlinear models. The course will present the foundations of probabilistic graphical models (e.g. Bayesian networks and Markov networks) as an overarching framework for unsupervised modelling. 

The website for the course is available to public here: http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/teaching/courses/ml1-2017/

## 2) Kernel Methods

Expanding on SVM topics covered in introductory machine learning modules, I have added notes on kernel methods from UCL's STAT0017. It gives a nice overview of spatial statistics which has a wide variety of application in every field.

Additionally it might be worth looking into Prof. John Shawe-Taylor and Nello Cristianini's excellent introduction to SVM and kernel methods:

One Book to rule them all, One Book to find them,

One Book to bring them all and in the probability bind them.
